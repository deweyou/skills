# Dewey Interface

This file is the design source of truth for Dewey's personal interface style.
It is meant to be read by humans and AI agents before making product UI
decisions.

`DESIGN.md` is closer to a project-level design contract than a workflow. Use it
with a UI/UX skill: the skill decides what work to do, and this file decides how
the interface should feel, read, and compose.

## Design Thesis

Dewey's interface style is restrained, typographic, component-driven, and
functional. It should feel like a small, carefully made product system rather
than a generic SaaS template.

Core judgment phrase:

> Simple, clean, and with clean lines. Less is more.

## Principles

- Solve usability before style. Personal taste must not override clarity,
  accessibility, recoverability, or platform conventions.
- Use structure before decoration: hierarchy, type, spacing, borders, and states
  carry the interface.
- Keep color semantic. Neutral colors structure the product, emerald marks
  primary emphasis, red is only for danger, and amber is feedback-only.
- Preserve calm density. Tools and dashboards should be compact and scannable;
  marketing surfaces can breathe more, but should not become decorative.
- Respect platform idioms. Web, H5, iOS, Android, HarmonyOS, mini programs, and
  macOS can share taste without sharing identical controls or navigation.
- Prefer accessible native or headless primitives for behavior instead of
  hand-rolling focus, keyboard, and ARIA logic.

## Typography

- Use Source Han Sans for controls, dense UI, navigation, labels, forms, and
  operational surfaces.
- Use Source Han Serif for content, Markdown, prose, editorial hierarchy, and
  display moments.
- Do not use serif everywhere. Controls should stay crisp and sans.
- Use weights 400, 500, 600, and 700 only.
- Keep display type for real display moments. Compact panels, cards, sidebars,
  and controls need smaller, tighter headings.
- Avoid negative letter spacing. Small uppercase labels may use modest positive
  tracking only when useful.

## Color

- Use semantic tokens instead of raw colors in components.
- Neutral / stone: text, borders, surfaces, neutral actions.
- Primary / emerald: selected states, focus, primary actions, brand emphasis.
- Danger / red: destructive actions and errors.
- Warning / amber: temporary feedback such as warning toasts, not a general
  component color.
- The logo or brand mark may use a gradient; product surfaces should not use
  decorative gradients.
- Functional color must not be the only carrier of meaning. Pair error, warning,
  success, and selected states with labels, icons, or shape when needed.

## Surface, Layout, And Density

- Canvas: neutral light gray in light mode; low-glare stone in dark mode.
- Surfaces: white or raised token surfaces, separated by borders first.
- Cards: 1px border, surface background, no shadow by default.
- Floating layers: dialogs, popovers, menus, and toasts can use shadow and
  raised surfaces.
- Spacing follows a 4px rhythm with established `xs`, `sm`, `md`, `lg`, and `xl`
  tiers.
- Radius uses existing tiers only: `rect`, `float`, `auto`, and `pill`.
- Avoid nested cards and decorative section containers.
- Reserve stable dimensions for controls, toolbars, grids, tabs, tiles, and
  counters so dynamic content does not shift layout.

## Interaction

- Touch targets should be at least 44px on mobile.
- Focus must be visible.
- Hover is never the only affordance.
- Press feedback should be quick and should not move surrounding layout.
- Loading should disable repeat actions, preserve layout width, and show progress
  or skeletons when useful.
- Disabled controls must not look tappable.
- Errors should explain cause and recovery near the affected area.
- Empty states should explain what is missing and provide the next useful action.
- Destructive actions should be visually separated and confirmed when risk is
  meaningful.
- Motion should be 140-300ms, cause-and-effect, transform/opacity where possible,
  and respect reduced motion.

## Iconography

- Use the host project's icon system when available.
- Prefer Tabler-style stroked SVG icons: 1.5 stroke, square linecap, miter
  linejoin.
- Use icons for tools and compact actions where recognizable.
- Icon-only controls need accessible names.
- Do not use emoji as structural UI icons.
- Keep icon family, stroke, size, and alignment consistent.

## Copy

User-facing copy should usually be concise English unless the product context
requires another language. Keep it factual and compact.

- Use clear nouns and action verbs.
- Avoid hype, slogans, inflated promises, and exclamation marks.
- Use `·` as the house separator for metadata, eyebrows, and parallel labels
  when it fits the product language.
- Button labels should be direct actions: `Save`, `Copy`, `Delete`, `Export`.
- Icon-only accessible names should describe the action: `Open menu`,
  `Open more actions`, `Close dialog`.

## Do

- Start with the user's real workflow and information hierarchy.
- Use neutral surfaces, border-first separation, compact hierarchy, and semantic
  color.
- Cover empty, loading, error, success, disabled, selected, focus, and destructive
  states.
- Design light and dark themes as a pair.
- Keep one primary action per screen.

## Don't

- Do not use decorative gradients, bokeh, glassmorphism, generic stock
  atmosphere, or cream/beige themes as the product's main visual language.
- Do not mix unrelated styles such as flat, skeuomorphic, glass, clay, brutalist,
  and neumorphic treatments in the same product.
- Do not use emoji as navigation, settings, or system icons.
- Do not make dashboards or tools feel like marketing pages.
- Do not use raw colors, arbitrary radii, or random shadows in components when
  semantic tokens exist.

## AI Design Prompt

Use this compact style brief when asking an AI design tool to work in Dewey's
style:

```text
Design in Dewey's current interface style: restrained English-first product UI, Source Han Sans controls, Source Han Serif content/display, neutral light-gray canvas, white bordered surfaces, deep emerald primary emphasis, red only for danger, no emoji, no decorative gradients, no glassmorphism, no generic stock atmosphere. Prioritize clear workflow, compact hierarchy, accessible touch targets, safe areas, visible states, and calm motion.
```
