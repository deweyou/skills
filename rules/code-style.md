# Code Style

Use this rule when writing, editing, or reviewing code unless project-level
instructions are more specific.

## Defaults

- Follow existing project conventions before applying generic preferences.
- Prefer clear, explicit code over clever or hidden behavior.
- Keep changes local and well bounded.
- Avoid mixing behavior changes, refactors, renames, and formatting churn when
  practical.

## Naming

- Use names that describe domain meaning, not incidental implementation mechanics.
- Avoid vague names such as `data`, `info`, `item`, `temp`, `result`, `manager`,
  `helper`, and `utils` when a more specific name is available.
- Name booleans as predicates, such as `isReady`, `hasAccess`, `canRetry`, or
  `shouldPersist`.
- Do not rely on comments to explain unclear names. Rename instead.

## Functions

- A function should do one thing at one level of abstraction.
- Keep parameters few. When several values travel together, model them as a
  named options object, value object, struct, or equivalent.
- Avoid flag parameters that make one function perform multiple behaviors.
- Make important side effects visible in the function name or API shape.
- Extract complex conditions into named predicates when the name reveals business
  meaning.

## Errors

- Do not swallow errors silently.
- Distinguish recoverable errors from unrecoverable errors.
- Convert or wrap errors at meaningful boundaries so callers receive errors at
  the right abstraction level.
- Error messages should help diagnose the problem without leaking secrets.

## Comments

- Comments should explain why, not narrate what the code already says.
- Comment non-obvious tradeoffs, external system quirks, compatibility
  constraints, security assumptions, and intentionally unusual decisions.
- Improve names and structure before adding explanatory comments.
- Delete or update stale comments immediately.

## Tests

- Test behavior, not incidental implementation details.
- Tests should make refactoring safer, not freeze the current implementation
  shape.
- Add or update tests when behavior changes, bugs are fixed, or shared contracts
  move.
- Prefer a failing regression test before fixing a bug when practical.
