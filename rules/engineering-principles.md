# Engineering Principles

Use this rule when designing modules, refactoring boundaries, adding
dependencies, or changing behavior with architectural impact.

## Boundaries

- Keep modules focused on one responsibility.
- A module should make its inputs, outputs, and dependencies clear.
- Do not let implementation details leak into callers.
- If callers must read a module's internals to use it safely, the boundary is not
  clear enough.
- Isolate external systems, third-party libraries, platform APIs, file systems,
  databases, clocks, randomness, and network calls behind clear project-owned
  boundaries.

## Easy-To-Delete Code

- Treat deletion cost as a design signal.
- Keep new behavior inside a clear boundary instead of spreading it through many
  unrelated files.
- Accept small, local duplication when it keeps modules independent and easier to
  remove.
- Do not create shared utilities until reuse is real and the boundary is clear.
- Put experimental features, compatibility layers, and risky dependencies behind
  adapters, feature flags, or isolated modules so they can be removed as a unit.
- Delete dead code. Do not keep code because it might be useful someday.

## Abstraction And Reuse

- Do not abstract for the first occurrence of a pattern.
- On the second occurrence, observe whether the duplication is accidental or
  meaningful.
- On the third occurrence, consider extracting an abstraction if it makes change
  more local or the caller simpler.
- A good abstraction gives a concept a useful name, hides volatility, and reduces
  coupling.
- A bad abstraction only removes a few lines while making future changes harder.
- Abstract at boundaries where change is likely, not in the middle of
  straightforward code.

## State And Side Effects

- Prefer explicit inputs and outputs.
- Keep side effects concentrated and visible.
- Do not mutate data you do not own.
- Avoid hidden global state and implicit context.
- Give state a clear owner and a clear lifecycle.
- Make concurrency, caching, time, retries, and ordering assumptions explicit.

## Dependencies

- Introduce dependencies deliberately.
- Before adding a dependency, evaluate the size of the problem, replacement cost,
  maintenance risk, and whether the dependency will leak into core logic.
- Do not let third-party APIs spread through business code.
- Wrap volatile or infrastructure-specific dependencies behind project-owned
  interfaces or adapter modules.
- Avoid adding a large dependency for a small utility.

## Change Shape

- Keep changes small and intentional.
- Prefer improving the code you are already touching over broad unrelated
  cleanup.
- If a simple request requires edits across many unrelated files, inspect the
  boundaries before continuing.
- Prefer deleting obsolete code over preserving compatibility paths without a
  clear exit condition.
- When compatibility code is necessary, document when and how it can be removed.
